I understand your confusion, death is something unusual to normal people.", "(Hero): What...Who are you?", "I am a guide that help people get to this other world. Now that you've came to this land, your fate shall be soon decided.", "(Hero): Fate...I understand now. This is the end for me then.", "Don't think of it as an end, but rather a new beginning. Yet, there's one thing I require to know from you. You see, I've been looking for someone who could acomplish something that is greatly important for me.", "(Hero): Is..is this some form of test? A challenge to truly decide whether I will be in paradise or tortured for eternity?", "No, it is not. It's my own request for which you seem to be ideal to.", "(Hero):...Fine then, I'm listening.", "Very well then. You see, there are beings among the living who shouldn't be there long time ago and yet, some disturbance let them be alive. They're causing havoc among the living. Many die before they're suppose to and that's what is an issue to me and yet I myself cannot do anything. I am but a link across life and death. Humans on the other hand, with my help all of you can return back to your bodies.", "(Hero): So what you ask of me is to get rid of those who cause such suffering? What will I get in return for dealing with this problem?", "I cannot grant much, but you are one of the people who have fallen because of Them, thus letting you go back to the world of living after you deal with Them is what I can give. I need to warn you of one thing before you consider agreeing.", "You will die, many, many times, before this task is acomplished. You know how painful death is and this feeling is going to always be with you on this quest. Well then, do you accept this task, descendant of Adam?", "(Hero):...I accept this task, but not for the gift of life, but rather due to a promise that I made myself. A revenge against Him, who dared to be a traitor, who dared to kill those of innocence. His wickedness shall know end."])
